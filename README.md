# ü§ñ Sarcasm Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

A machine learning project to detect sarcasm in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various classification algorithms like KNN and SVM.

---

## üìå Overview

Sarcasm is subtle and often difficult to detect, even for humans. This project builds a supervised machine learning model that classifies text as sarcastic or not by applying NLP preprocessing and training on labeled datasets.
